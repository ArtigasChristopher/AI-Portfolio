# 🌅 DreamLens – AI-Powered Photo Gallery

> **DreamLens** is a mobile gallery app enhanced by **on-device AI**.  
> It brings a new way to explore memories by tagging photos with moods, vibes, and contexts — all running locally, without sending data to the cloud.  

---

## 🎯 Goal
Most gallery apps focus on storage and organization. DreamLens focuses on **experience**:  
- Aesthetic design with *liquid glass* UI and pastel gradients.  
- AI-powered tagging to surface photos by **emotion or vibe**.  
- Second Memory, ask any detail of your photographic past, and find it.
- Full **offline privacy**, with inference happening on-device.
- Connecting to the closest the AI to the design for user use.

## 🚀 What I Built
- **On-Device Image Analysis**  
  - Local models for vibe & mood classification.  
  - Generates semantic tags like *Happy*, *Sunset*, *Beach*.  

- **Dynamic Grid UI**  
  - Gallery layout with 1×1, 2×1, 2×2 tiles, letting more space for important moments.  
  - Smooth transitions and interactive photo zoom.  

- **Design Language**  
  - Pastel lilac → peach gradient (“Sunset Glass”).  
  - Rounded corners, soft shadows, floating tag marquee.  

---

## 📊 Results
- Functional prototype running on Android (Jetpack Compose).  
- Optimized for responsive layouts and light animations.  
- AI tagging tested on-device with compact vision models.  

---

## 🎥 Demo
📌 Demos will be made available once the repository is no longer private.
In the meantime:  
- **Screenshots & gifs** will be added here.  
- **Full video walkthrough** will be linked for a deeper look.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages** → Kotlin, Python  
- **Mobile** → Android Jetpack Compose, BlurView, Material 3  
- **AI/ML** → PyTorch, ONNX, lightweight vision models (llama.cpp integration planned)  
- **Other** → FastAPI (backend), Docker  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add advanced user tagging and multi-device sync.  
- Expand AI features: scene description, object detection.  
- Integrate voice-based photo search (“Show me happy sunsets”).
