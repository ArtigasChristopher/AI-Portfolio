# 🧠 AI Portfolio – Christopher Artigas

Welcome! This repository is a curated portfolio of my work in **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on:
- 🌍 **Language Learning** – building tools to make learning more natural.
- 🔬 **Applied AI** – from voice health detection to image-based tagging.

I’m currently in my final year at **EPITECH (France)** and working part-time as an AI Engineer.  
My goal is to bridge research and product, turning AI into **real-world applications**.
